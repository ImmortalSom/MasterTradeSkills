### Required addons
- [ReagentData](https://github.com/refaim/ReagentData)

### Description
This addon is an information tool for all you trade skill loving fools! It will alter the tooltips of ingredients and tells you the following things:

- It shows current trade skill level
- It shows recipes where the selected ingredient is used in
- It shows 'where' you can get the recipe (vendor, quest, etc.)
- It shows what tradeskill level is required to use the recipe
- It will show the skill color of the recipe. Or shows it in red if you don't know it yet
- It will save everything between sessions per character

Adjustable options. Show what skills you want to see. Show only learned or not learned recipes.

### Usage
To use Master Trade Skills, just install it. To let the addon know what recipes you know you have to open all your tradeskill windows first (tailoring, first aid, etc.). Next time you hover over an ingredient you will see the recipes in the tooltip.

You can open addon settings with `/mts options` slash command.

### Legacy README from Triadian
> No idea why this mod slipped into non-existance, so i dragged it back kicking and screaming - if you wanna flame me
> for doing you will be ignored at Triadian@Gmail.com i will only be updating at http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=2146
> and http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-4773-master-trade-skills.html
> so if you write a comment elsewhere i might not see it.
> 
> any nice suggestions or improvements let me know and i'll try and implement them
> but my knowledge of UI isn't that brilliant.

> German Localization by Farook. Thanks
